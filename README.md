# Funny Way
This is simple social network which I've created as my first mini-project with
Ruby on Rails.

The main purpose was to explore possibilities of this technology, develop some
skills and create my own website. At present, project is finished, but has
initial state. Piece by piece I'll develop it.

## "Funny way" features
The mini-social network includes below features:

- Authentication and authorization system, which was developed from scratch.
- Mailers. They are used for sending authentication and reset-password tokens.
- Guest book with information about people.
- General chat where all members can share they thought.
- Photo galleries. Every member can create they own photo gallery and manage it.
- Comments. People can leave messages under any photo.
- Ability to change language.
- Photo uploader. I've created my own system so every person can manage photos
  before saving it in album.
